# A\* Path Finding

This is a comprehensive project for learning how pathfinding algorithms work. In this project, [A\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) is implemented, then optimized by [Heap Binary Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_Binary_Tree) which is much faster than the first implementation.

It also covers, genuin ways of developing and debuging (by using Gizmos) and how to improve fractioned movements, into a smooth one. It also supports running many units on seperate threads.

### Features
- Algoritm explained
- Automatic grid generation
- Heap algorithm (optimized version)
- Multiple units can be used
- Unique weights for unique paths
- Smoothed weights (Blur method)
- Smooth movement on path
- Multi-threaded


### Other
This project is based on a great tutorial by [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L-WgKMFuhE&list=PLFt_AvWsXl0cq5Umv3pMC9SPnKjfp9eGW)
